# Game Theory Projects

Various interesting game theory related projects to find the optimum solution (if any)

Game theory - the study of mathematical models of strategic interaction among rational decision-makers.

Consists of various notebooks/projects of different games, where I create simulations for bots with different strategies to play with each other. The main goal is to find the optimum solution, if there is one, for each game.


## Games

### Split or Steal

The game starts with a pot of money, and a pool of money is taken out each round. Each player is given a set of choice: "Split" or "Steal" (chosen secretly).
- If both choose Split, they each get half the money from the pool.
- If one chooses Steal and the other chooses Split, the Steal contestant gets the entire pool money and the Split contestant gets nothing.
- If both choose Steal, neither contestant gets any money and the pool is return to the pot.

The game ends when the pot is depleted or it reaches the maximum amount of rounds, whichever comes first.
